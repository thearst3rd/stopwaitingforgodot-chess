### #StopWaitingForGodot Chess - by Terry Hearst (thearst3rd)

#StopWaitingForGodot Chess is my entry to Terry Cavanaugh's #StopWaitingForGodot game jam. I had a lot of fun working on this project! I previously attempted to make chess in Godot some months ago but failed miserably. But after participating in the GMTK Game Jam 2021 and using Godot for that, I felt I had a better shot and that I could give it another go. I learned a lot during this project, including how to use the built in drag and drop functionality, groups, singletons, and defining my own object classes! I documented some of the development process in [Log section of README.md](README.md#log), go check it out if you're interested!
