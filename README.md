# Simple Godot Chess

A simple chess implementation in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). This is my entry in Terry Cavanaugh's [STOP WAITING FOR GODOT](https://itch.io/jam/stop-waiting-for-godot) Jam!

This readme will detail some of the things I learned and the resources I used to learn them. Come back later when the jam is done :)
